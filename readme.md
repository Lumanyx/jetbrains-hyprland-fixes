This is a random collection of fixes & notes for fixing some of the weirdness JetBrains IDEs have on Hyprland.
These things may or may not work, I just decided to publish it because it may be useful to some.

Includes:
- A few notes regarding how to fix some of the DPI scaling weirdness
- A Python script which is a workaround to fixing distorted/stretched dialogs (e.g. Go to file)
